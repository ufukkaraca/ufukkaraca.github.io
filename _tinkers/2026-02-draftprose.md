summary: ai-assisted drafting for when the blank page wins
---
A small writing tool I put together with Next.js and a sprinkle of Gemini. The idea was to have something local-first that helps me get past the blank page — not by writing for me, but by nudging drafts along. Has a demo mode if you want to poke around without setting anything up. [Source on GitHub](https://github.com/ufukkaraca/rodyr_draftprose_web).
