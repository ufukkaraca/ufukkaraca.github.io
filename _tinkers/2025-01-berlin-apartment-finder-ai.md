summary: cold-reach but for apartments

I got fed up with the stressful and time-consuming process of finding an apartment in Berlin. So I built a simple AI agent that automates the cold-reach process for me. It scrapes listings from off-the-beaten-path sources like family offices, wealth managers and small landlords, drafts personalized emails, and tracks responses. Found me an apartment in 2 weeks. Would've loved to open-source it but as a quick hack it is a bit of a mess and I don't have the bandwidth to clean it up.
