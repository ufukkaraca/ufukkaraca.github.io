I wanted all my watched movies in one place on Letterboxd but wasn't about to manually re-enter years of Netflix and Prime history. This is a lightweight Python CLI that takes your streaming export files and spits out a Letterboxd-compatible CSV. No dependencies beyond the standard library, runs on Python 3.6+.
