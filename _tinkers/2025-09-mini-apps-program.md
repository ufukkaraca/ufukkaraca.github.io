summary: trying to vibe code in trains
---
Trying to vibe code during my commutes, intercity travels, and moments of boredom. A mix of small scripts, experiments, and prototypes that capture fleeting ideas or solve minor annoyances. Started with a simple vibe-journal called RealToMe, and posting a bit more on X to see what people resonate with.

These have resulted so far in:
- [RealToMe](https://realtome.app): a vibe-journal to capture the day.
- [Align Social](https://alignsocial.app): a hyper-local networking app.
