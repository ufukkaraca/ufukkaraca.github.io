Trying to vibe code during my commutes, intercity travels, and moments of boredom. A mix of small scripts, experiments, and prototypes that capture fleeting ideas or solve minor annoyances. Started with a simple vibe-journal called RealToMe, and posting a bit more on X to see what people resonate with.
