excerpt: Tiny integration points compound into architectural leverage.

I keep a running list of tiny integration wins: a shared enum between services, a log correlation ID propagated one more hop, a CLI flag that lets me replay a prod request locally. Individually they look like bikeshedding. Collectively they raise the *surface area of leverage* in the system.

You rarely get to refactor a whole platform at once. You almost always can slip in a 15‑minute connective tissue improvement. Shipping those relentlessly is how architectures *actually* get better.
