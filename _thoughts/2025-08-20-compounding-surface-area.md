Shipping a narrow, well-named interface week 2 of a project feels premature. Week 20 you realize it quietly enabled 6 side efforts without coordination overhead.

Early surface area (if curated) is an accelerant: it lets parallel exploration happen without high merge friction. The trick is to prune *aggressively* anything not exercised within a couple of weeks so the surface doesn't calcify into legacy.
